title: "'One by One' by Ruth Ware"
description: An intriguing locked room mystery but in this case, it's more of a locked chalet mystery. My favourite part about the book is that if you are looking for clues, you can figure out who the murderer is before the big reveal. I appreciate it when the author doesn't pull a rabbit out of their hat at the last minute to confuse everyone.
